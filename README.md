# Project1-To-Do-List
### Description
Application requirements:
- The items entered in the field are assembled into a list on  the page by pressing the button.
- The content of the input fields must be checked for blank as well as incorrect (eg too short) content
- Incorrect content in the input field causes an error message as well as an incorrect field highlighting (eg red border).
- It must be possible to remove elements from the list and mark the task as done
- The application CSS and JavaScript must be specified in an external CSS file
- The information in the list is stored in a browser, eg localstorage
Additional functions:
- You can implement a counter that shows the number of open items in the list
- Try to come up with some meaningful way to hide and show elements in the app.
- You can implement buttons (also shown at the bottom of the image) that only display active or completed tasks
